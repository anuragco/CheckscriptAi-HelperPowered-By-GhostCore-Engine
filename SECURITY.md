### Security Issue Reporting
Security vulnerabilities should be reported through responsible disclosure procedures to prevent potential exploitation.

**Contact Information**: security@checkscript.site

**Required Information for Reports:**
- Detailed description of the vulnerability and discovery method
- Current application version in use
- Supporting documentation (screenshots, logs, etc.)
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions

**Response Commitment**: All security reports will receive acknowledgment within 48 hours, with resolution timeframes communicated based on severity assessment.

### Security Implementation
**Application Isolation**: The software employs Electron's contextIsolation feature to maintain strict separation between application components, preventing unauthorized cross-component access.

**Inter-Process Communication Security**: All internal application communications utilize whitelisted IPC channels to ensure only authorized message routing.

**Continuous Security Maintenance**: All application dependencies and components undergo regular security updates to address emerging vulnerabilities and maintain security posture.
