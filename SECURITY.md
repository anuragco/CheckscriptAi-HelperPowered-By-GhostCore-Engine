🛡️ How We Keep You Safe
🔐 Context Isolation: The app uses special security walls (called Electron's contextIsolation) to keep different parts of the app separated - like having security doors in a building!
📋 IPC Whitelisting: Only approved messages can travel between different parts of the app - like having a bouncer at a club who only lets in people on the list!
🔄 Always Updated: We regularly update all the app's components to fix any security issues that might pop up!
